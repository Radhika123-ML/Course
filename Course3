Dynamic Programming

In Dynamic programming i learnt efficient problem-solving by breaking complex tasks into simpler subproblems, optimizing time and space through memorization, state transition, and recursive or iterative approaches. It emphasizes optimal substructure and addresses a wide range of algorithmic and optimization challenges.
